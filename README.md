# XIVLogger

Very much a work in progress plugin for XIVLauncher!

A simple chat log plugin that logs chat messages from when the plugin is turned on, and then dumps it to a text file in your documents at a press of a button.

Primarily intended for saving roleplay logs.

Supports saving the following chat types at the moment:

Say, Shout, Yell, Party/CrossParty, Alliance, Tells, Emotes (Custom, Standard), Cross World Linkshells 1 - 8, Linkshells 1 - 8, PVP Team, Novice Network, Free Company


## Commands

``/xivlogger`` to bring up settings plus button
``/savelog`` to save the log from when the plugin is activated

## To Do

* Actual documentation and help text
* <strike>Slash commands</strike>
* Specify a filepath to save to, instead of assuming a Documents folder exists
* Turning on and off categories of chat texts, like all linkshells
* Saving combinations of different chat types and naming them?
* Do the chat settings actually persist?
* Timestamps
* Adding commands to save all messages from a specified time
* Adding commands to save the last <i>n</i> amount of messages
* Load chat log into copy and paste?
* I'd love a way to save logs based on chat tab configurations, but I have no idea how to do this
