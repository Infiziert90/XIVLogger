# XIVLogger

Very much a work in progress plugin for XIVLauncher!

A simple chat log plugin that logs chat messages from when the plugin is turned on, and then dumps it to a text file in your documents at a press of a button.

Primarily intended for saving roleplay logs.

## To Do

* Actual documentation and help text
* Slash commands
* Specify a filepath to save to, instead of assuming a Documents folder exists
* Turning on and off categories of chat texts, like all linkshells
* Saving combinations of different chat types and naming them?
* Do the chat settings actually persist?
* Timestamps
* Adding commands to save all messages from a specified time
* Load chat log into copy and paste?
* Experimental option to automatically filter out OOC brackets for roleplay purposes? (probably not, boo regex)
